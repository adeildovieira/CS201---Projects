# CS201 Projects
Projects made for Computer Science 201 - Data Structures and Algorithms @ Duke University.

- The projects scope have been made for COMPSCI201 at Duke by Prof. Owen Astrachan, Ph.D and Prof. Brandon Fain, Ph.D., being great parts of the code removed and substituted with a TO-DO instruction, for us, students, to be completed with our knowledgment of Data Structures and Programming Logic.

- Projects 0 and 1: Introduction to Objected Oriented Programming. Use of static and driver methods, constructors and objects.
- Project 2 Markov: Application of ArrayList, HashSet/HashCode on random Markov processes; Insight on text-generation models via statistical machine learning program.
- Project 3 DNA: Application of the linked list data structure toward a real world problem in scientific computing.
- Project 4 Autocomplete: HashMap application of the autocomplete algorithm. Worked with Comparator/Comparable methods.
- Project 5 Huffman and Project 6 are upcoming.
